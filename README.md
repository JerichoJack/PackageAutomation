# PackageAutomation
Python dependency automation, because I cant be bothered to help users.


Instruct users to run the install_dependencies.bat. This will cover the prereq for the PIP_Check.py.

Once that completes, user then run PIP_Check.py.
It will open a file explorer window for the user to select the python program to examine.
The PIP_Check.py will install needed packages, and not the process in the log.txt
